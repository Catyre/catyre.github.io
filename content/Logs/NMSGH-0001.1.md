##  Iteration Biographical
**Name:** Iteration: Arcturus
**Starship:** *Swordfish III*  | fighter class
**Current Objective:**  Expand resource supply chain to facilitate larger builds 
**Species:** Autophage  
**Role/Profession:** [Explorer | Builder | Cartographer]  
**Alignment:** Neutral 
**Companions (if any):** None
**Affiliation(s):** Galactic Hub, Calypso Galactic Hub
## Log Summary

 > [!log] Log Transcription
> Work continues on establishing a stable supply of resources and income.  Each settlement is gradually improving in productivity, though there haven't been as many building opportunities as I would hope for any of them.
> 
>  An idea struck me today to build "explorer barracks" for newcomers to the galactic hub.  We afford their room and board, and in exchange they will chart hubspace systems for us.  Will revisit this idea at a later date.  The priority right now is expanding supply chain
> 
> My first sub orbital base, Earth in the Sky, has begun construction.  The hope is to fashion it into a general purpose farming compound but the focus right now is to create a stable supply of star bulbs.  It will make much use of glitch building and, being on Caladan, will ideally be the hub of my resource gathering.
> 
> CalHub is still in search for a new capital.  Although I have my own goals in across the galaxies right now, I think it may be worth it to temporarily shift my focus to the capital search

## Session Notes
<big>**Discoveries**</big>
-   Encountered the planet Ventoneh VI (HUB12-D5) through a Nexus mission.  A haunted emeril planet within CalHub, it holds a beautiful diplosaurus variant (see documentation) as well as S tier electromagnetic power and Oxygen.  In fact, I set up an oxygen farm there since I did not have a better one 
  
<big>**Technological Upgrades**</big>
  - None noteworthy

<big>**Notable Events:** </big>
  - Began construction of Earth in the Sky, Caladan's home farming compound and the intended supply of star bulbs for stasis devices
  - Decorated the fishing platform in Caladan fish hut (see [[#Documentation]])
  - Progressed each settlement's development
  - Converted most of the agricultural capacity on **UNSC ALL Under Atlas** to produce sac venom

##  Going Forward
- Continue working on Earth in the Sky
- Complete conversion to sac-venom production
- Increase priority for locating prospective CalHub capitals
- The search for the bone worm continues...
- Quicksilver is always needed

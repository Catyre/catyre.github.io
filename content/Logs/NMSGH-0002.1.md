## Log Summary

 > [!log] Log Transcription
> Earth in the Sky has been significantly modified.  It now has a proper starship dock, a short-range teleport terminal to get to the star bramble forest below, and the already existing star bulb production capacity has been increased.  Although the sub-orbital part of the base still needs much work, I am already quite pleased with how the forest is turning out.  I'll send a photocapture along with this log.
> 
> To expand on the idea, I will need more quicksilver to unlock more plantlike base parts for arboreal decorations.  This will no doubt take much time.  I'm eager to see a finished product, however.  Most of this session was spent on either constructing Earth in the Sky or completing Nexus missions

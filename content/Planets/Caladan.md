## Notes & Observations
> [!visual-doc] Notes from the Soideos Interface
> Caladan is my homeworld.  Its gorgeous purple and red trees, the vast expanse of jagged mountains then freckled coastlines make for perhaps the most beautiful planet I have yet encountered.  Sitting just outside calhubspace, it's unlikely that others will find this system on their own.  Who knows though, maybe after enough development I will open the planet to other's eyes.  For now, I quite enjoy having this slice of paradise to myself.
> 
> As my personal homeworld, many bases have been/will be constructed on Caladan.  At this moment, there is a fish hut for leisure time on the planet's breathtaking oceans.  I am also in the process of building a complete farm compound, **Earth in the Sky**, which will streamline a great deal of my farming workflow
